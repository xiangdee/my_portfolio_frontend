                        As a software engineer at Dav_inchi International, I played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining a 
                        comprehensive on-premise distributed system using Windows Server and Python Flask. 

                        One notable accomplishment was the successful integration of Salesforce API into the on-premise portal, enhancing 
                        the platform&lsquo;s functionalities. Additionally, I contributed to the company&lsquo;s online presence by designing, 
                        developing, and deploying a user-friendly WordPress website.
